summary: We trained an end-to-end image compression model convolutional
  autoencoder. This model can compress a high-resolution image in a
  block-by-block manner. PCA was applied to further improve the coding
  efficiency.

# Introduction

In this project, we implemented an autoencoder-based end-to-end image compression model.
